## wireless infrastructure security ##
__WAP:__ wireless access point, creates an area for a wireless device to be able to connect to the network. <br>
important for both ease of usage and security, if WAP is close to external wall, connect can be access from outside the permitted location. <br>
__Site Survey__: process of planning and desiging a wireless network to provide a solution. <br>
__Heat Map__: graphical representation of wireless coverage, signal strength, and frequency utilization at different locations. <br>
## wireless security settings ##
Know! --> <br>
*WEP:* Wired Equivalent Privacy, very outdated, practically provides no security.weak 24-bit initization vector, and one key usage for all packets sent <br>
*WPA:* Wifi Protected Access, temporary improvement over WEP while a more robust solution was in creation. used 128 bit keys, new for each packet sent <br>
*WPA2:* improved data protection and network access control by addressing weaknesses in WPA, mainly issues with TKIP cryptographic strength, now swapping to AES for encryption and CCMP. <br>
*WPA3:* latest version that uses AES encryption with new features like SAE, Enhanced Open, updated cryptographic protocols, and management protection frames. no longer uses 4 way handshake which had issues in WPA2 and before. <br>

cool video i found on wpa2 vulnerability through MIM, SSL stripping, Wireshark, and key reinstallation! <br>

## application security ##
__application security__: aspect of software development that focuses on building applications that are secure by design. <br>
* Input Validation: gatekeeper that ensures that applications only act on well defined and uncontaminated data.
* Secure Cookies: small pieces of data stored data client side, use secure cookies to make sure that can not be manipulated.
* Static Code Analysis: a method of debuging an application by reviewing it before it can even run or execute.
* Dynamic Code Analysis: testing method that analysis an application while its running for logic and runtime errors.
* Code Signing: technique used to make sure that a piece of code is not modifying maliciously or change without being known. hash signatures!
* Sandboxing: security machanism to isolate running programs for extensive testing and limits malicious activity from spreading from application.
