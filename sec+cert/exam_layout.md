#### general exam tips: ####
1. multiple choice questions tend to have a red herring answer, try to find which answer makes most sense
2. take extra note to questions that have highlighted, bolded, or all uppercase text, the context is important
3. utilize sec+ comptia knowledge FIRST
4. understand the concepts the question is asking
5. vendor neutral, know tools, but not exactly how to use the tool
