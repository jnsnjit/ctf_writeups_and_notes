## MALWARE! (BIG SECTION) ##
DEF: Any software designed to infiltrate a computer system without the user's knowledge. <br>
*requires a threat and attack vector thought in order to get introduced into a system.*<br>
Threat Vector --> breaks into a system       <br>
Attack Vector --> breaks in and infect system       <br>

## Virus ## 
__def: malicious software that attaches to clean files and spreads in a computer system.__<br>
       10 TYPES!!
- Boot Sector: stored in first sector of a hard drive, and is loaded into memory first on boot up. these are difficult to detect due to them being install prior to your OS. this means they can avoid anti-virus detect again because they exist before the OS where the anti virus software is.
- Macro: form of code that has a virus embedded within another document in order to hide itself, is processed when papa document is executed.
- Program: tries to find executable/app files to infect with malicious code.
- Multipartite: combination of a boot sector and program virus (OUCH!!).
- Encrypted: designed to hide itself from detection by encrypting its malicious payloads to avoid anti-virus detection.
- Polymorphic: advanced version of encrypted, not only will it encrypt its contexts, it will also periodically alter its code to further evade detection. (warps hashing sig)
- Metamorphic: rewrite itself ENTIRELY (bruh)
- Stealth: not specific, but the techiniques these virus implement focus on avoid anti-virus detection.
- Armor: have a layer of protection to confuse program/person analyzing it, kind of like a kid in a trenchcoat.
- Hoax: NOT a virus, but a social enginnering tactic instilled to scare end users into thinking their is a virus on the machine and will do something unless the user gives information, money, etc...
## Worms ##
__def: standalone malware programs that replicate and spread to other systems by exploiting software vulnerabilities.__<br>
worms unlike virus dont need the user in order to replicate, spread, and come.
- will take up A LOT of network traffic due to them be able to work by themselves.
- can easily infect other workstations on a network.

## Trojans ## 
__def: malicious programs which appear to be legitimate software that allow unauthorized access to a victim's system when execute.__<br>
*RAT --> remote access trojan, gives attacker remote control of victim machine.

## Ransomware ##
__def: encrypts a user's data and holds it hostage until a ransom is paid to the attacker for decryption.__<br>
how to mitigate/prevent:
- conduct REGULAR backups, stored away and off the network
- installing regular software updates to prevent vulnerablities CV's
- provide security awareness training
- implementing MFA for systems
- DONT pay ransom
- disconnect compromised device from network
## Zombies and Botnets ##
__def(zombies): compromised computers that are remotely controlled by attackers and used in coordination to form a botnet.__<br>
__def(botnet): network of zombies and are often used for DDoS attacks, spam distribution, or cryptocurrency mining.__<br>
goal is create network of devices with there processing power in order to acheive a goal that recieves a lot of computing power. can pinpoint blame onto different devices, or store illegal stuff..
C2 --> central server
## Rootkits ##
__def: malicious tools that hide their activities and operate at the OS level to allow for ongoing privileged access.__<br>
worst thing for a user is to have a virus with root/administrative permissions ðŸ’€ <br>
OS gives permissions in levels, with 0 being something like the kernel, in which a sys/user has control of drivers, sound cards, monitors, and other core processess, with maybe like level three being base permissions.
*DLL Injection: OS like windows uses something called dynamic link lib's (DLL's), which basically allow the reuse of certain core code for multiple processes, in which DLLi is a virus/payloads attempt to mask itself in a DLL.
## Backdoors and Logic Bombs ##
__def(backdoors): malicious means of bypassing normal authentication processes to gain unauthorized access to a system.__<br>
__def(logic bombs): embed code placed in legitimate programs that execute a malicious action when a specific condition or trigger occurs. (linux terminal logic bombs go brrrr)__<br>

## Keyloggers ##
__def: recording a users keystrokes and are used to capture passwords or other sensitive information.__<br>
Software --> installed software that logs keystrokes and sends to attacker. <br>
Hardware --> physical device plugged in that logs info.<br>
## Spyware and Bloatware ##
__def(spyware): secretly monitors and gathers user information or activities and sends data to third parties.__<br>
__def(bloatware): unnecessary/pre-installed software that consumes system resources and space without offering value to the user.__<br>
removing bloatware can be annoying!<br>
1. manual removal, windows --> software --> uninstall --> may be harder then just this
2. use third party bloatware removal tools.
3. do clean operating system installation.

## Malware Exploitation Techniques + Indications of an Attack ##
fileless malware: preform some type of shell operation, avoid file and malicious hash signitures that anti-malware softwares may have.
- Dropper: init or runs other malware forms within a payload on an infected host.
- Downloader: retrieves additional tools post the init infection by the dropper.
- Shellcode: is lightweight code meant to execute an exploit on a given target.

__Indications of an Attack:__
* Account Lockouts - may trigger failed logon attempts, remember investigating windows tryhackme? *
* Concurrent Session Utilization - multiple sessions of the same user on a network. *
* Blocked Content - increase in blocked links *
* Impossible Travel - two user logon in impossibly far away locations (i.e one in NYC, one in L.A within a minute) *
* Resource Consumption - increase of CPU, Memory, and Network utilization on device *
* Resource Inaccessibility - increase of inaccessible files *
* Out-of-cycle logging - activity when it does not make sense (middle of the night) *
* Missing Logs - deleting logs from activity (missing time zone) *
* Published or Documented Attack - report saying have been attacked. *
