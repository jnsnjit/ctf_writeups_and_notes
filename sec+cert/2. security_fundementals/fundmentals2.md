## confidentiality ##
def: refers to the protection of imformation from authorized access and disclosure

__why is it important:__
- protecting personal privacy (user information)
- maintaining a business advantage (closed source code)
- achieve regulatory compliance (industry standards like PPI)

5 METHODS:         ENCRYPTION|ACCESS CONTROLS|DATA MASKING|PHYSICAL SECURITY MEASURES|TRAINING AND AWARENESS <br>

EN --> proccess of converting data into code to prevent unauthorized access (hashing)
AC --> ensuring only authorized personal can access certain types of data
DM --> method that obsures data within a database to make it inaccessible for unauthorized users
PS --> ensures confidentiality for physical types of data (locks, camera, etc...)
TA --> regular employee training for employee best practices

confidentiality <--> encryption <br>

## integrity ## 

def: helps ensure that information and data remain accurate and unchanged from their original state unless intentionally modified by an authorized individual. <br>

- ensures data accuracy
- maintain trust
- ensures sytem operability

__5 TYPES OF INTEGRITY CHECKS:__

HASHING: converting data into fixed-size value. if data is just slightly modified, hash looks very different.
*hashdigest*
DIGITIAL SIG's: use encryption to ensure integrity and authenticity.
CHECKSUMS: method to verify the integrity of data during transmission.
ACCESS CONTROLS: ensure only authorized users can modify data. 
*read/write permissions*
REGULAR AUDITS: logging operations to make sure no discrepancies occured.

## availability ##
def: ensures that information, systems, and resources are accessible and operational when needed by authorized users.

just as much as we want security for our end-point users, we also want services to be availible...<br>
- ensures business continuity
- maintains customer trust
- upholds an organization's reputation

what can help... (fault tolerancy!)
_Redundancy: duplicate important functions of a system to enhance reliability_ <br>
_Server Redundancy: use multiple servers for load balancing, when one goes down, others can pick up_ <br>
_Data Redundancy: store data in different areas_ <br>
_Network Redundancy: more then one network paths_ <br>
_Power Redundancy: involves using backup power sources to ensure a system remains powered._ <br>

## authentication ##
def: security measures that ensure individuals or entities are who they claim to be during a communication or transaction

how to authenicate (5 common way)
- Something you know: Call on information a user can recall (username/password)
- Something you have: present a physical item (id,usb key,smartphone)
- Something you are: inherence - biometrics (fingerprint, facial)
- Something you do: action - unique action to verify identity
- Something you are: location - geographic location for access
__combine multiple of these factors and you get multifactor authenication (2FA)(MFA)__

## authorization ## 
def:permissions and privileges granted to users or entities after they have been authenticated <br>
who has access to WHAT   (read, modify, write, edit, view)

## accounting ##
def: security measure that ensure all user activities are properly tracked and recorded. <br>
examples of when to *audditting*:
- logging into a system
- accessing a file
- modifying configuration settings 
- downloading or installing software
- attempting unauthorized actions on systems and networks

__DEFINITIONS__
*Audit Trail: provides a record of all user activities that can be used to trace changes, unauthorized access, or anomalies back to a specific user or point of time.*<br>
*Regulatory Compliance: maintains a comprehensive records of all the user activities.*<br>
*Forensic Analysis: uses detailed accounting and event logs that can help cybersecurity experts understand what happened, how, and preventation.*<br>
*Resource Optimization: orgs can optimize system performance and minimize costs by tracking resource utilization and allocation decisions.*<br>
*User Accountability: ensure users actions are monitored and logged, detering potential misuse and promoting adherence to the organization.*<br>

how to log -->   SYSLOG tools, Network Analysis Tools, SIEMs (Security Information and Event Management Systems)<br>

Syslog Servers: aggregate logs from various devices to one consolidated place for analyzing <br>
Network Analysis Tools: capture and analysis network traffic (WireShark) <br>
SIEM's: real-time analysis of security alerts generated by various hardware and software infra in a org. <br>
