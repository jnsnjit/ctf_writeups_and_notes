## vulnerability management ##
__vulnerability management__: systematic process of identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, and mitigating vulnerabilitiies. <br>
## identifying vulnerabilities ##
Some ways of identifying vulnerabilities!
* _Vulnerability Scanning_: automated method of probing networks, systems, and applications to discover potential vulnerabilities. good example of some programs include Nessus and OpenVAS. 
* _Application Security_: used to safeguard the software from being manipulated during its lifecycle. 
* _System and Process Audits_: process that involves a comprehensive review of information systems, security policies, and procedures.
## threat intelligence feeds ##
__threat intelligence__: continual process used to understand the threats faced by an organization. <br>
this types of threats include --> new malware signatures, indicators of compromise, malicious IP addresses, URL's, ... <br>

__Sources of Threat Intelligence:__
1. Open-source Intelligence (OSINT!)
Intelligence that is collected from publically available sources including reports, forums, articles, blogs, and social media.
2. Proprietary or third party feeds
Threat intelligence feeds that are provided by commercial vendors, usually a subscription service business model. <br>
examples include: FireEye, McAfee, and Symantec.
3. Information-sharing organizations
Industry Information hubs for personalized threat vectors, like finance, healthcare, and energy.
4. The Dark Web
Part of the Internet that is intellional hidden and made easily accessable by modern browsers.

## responsible disclosure programs ##
__responsible disclosure__: term used to describe the ethical practice where a security researcher discloses information about vulnerabilities in a software, hardware, or online service. <br>
responsible disclosure -----> bug bounties

these systems can help:
1. Increase Security
2. Foster Community Collaboration
3. Very cost effective
## analyzing vulnerabilities ##
Some Characteristic and Traits of Vulnerabilities:
1. *Confirmation* --> is this a true positive, false positive, true negative, __false negative__
2. *Prioritization* --> rank vulnerabilities, usually by number 1-10, and how severe the vulnerability is.
3. *Classification* --> type of threat, potential impact, system/data that is affected.
4. *Organizational Impact* --> how much a vulnerability effects an org. (patient data or finanical impact)
5. *Exposure Factor* --> EF: quntifiable measure of how much a risk will cost an org if actually impacted.
6. *Risk Tolerance* --> level of risk that an organization is available to accept before focusing on it.

CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures): standardized way to uniquely identify and reference known vulnerabilities in software and hardware.

## vulnerability response and management ##
__response and remediation__: strategies that identify, assess, and address vulnerabilities in the network/system to strengthen an org's security posture. <br>
Some things to consider for Remediation:
1. Patching
2. Cybersecurity Insurance
3. Network Segmentation
4. Implementing Compenstating Controls
5. Granting Exemptations and Exceptions
### validating remediation ###
This is done through:
1. Rescans --> making sure that vulnerability has been resolved
2. Audits --> verifying that issue is not recreated / still exists
3. Verification --> testing that vulnerability no longer works + user verification that regular functions still work
## vulnerability reporting ##
__vulnerability reporting__: process of documenting and communicating details about security weaknesses identified in software or systems to the individuals/orgs responsible for addressing the issue. <br>
__Internal Reporting:__ issues are reporting internally so that security posture is understood and timely. <br>
__External Reporting:__ discussion of vulnerability with vendor, users, and external groups. <br>
__Responsible Disclosure__: collabing with vendor to discuss vulnerability before disclosing publically. <br>

Vulnerability Report MUST have some level of confidentially. You are basically saying how your network is vulnerable, so that information is very valuable, and only for people who need to know. <br>
