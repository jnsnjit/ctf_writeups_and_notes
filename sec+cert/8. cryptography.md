## cryptography: solutions ##
__cryptography: practice and study of writing and solving codes to hide the true meaning of the data.__<br>
__encryption: process of converting ordinary information(plaintext) into an unintelligible form(ciphertext).__<br>
_cipher: an algorithm that performs the encryption/decryption._<br>

the thing to understand is that its not necessarily the encryption method that makes the data secure, but instead the key. the key is what protects the data from being decrypted by unauthorized people. the larger the key, and the more it changes, the better your encryption. <br>

## Symmetric Encryption ##
__def: use the same key for both encryption and decryption. this key is private.__<br>

*issues arise such as everyone would need keys for communication to anyone, non-rediputation, and lack of knowledge in communication between people. however, they tend to be a lot faster then asymmetric encryption*<br>

## Asymmetric Encryption ##
__def: use a pair of keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.__<br>
*deals with key giving out problem with symmetric encryption bc well, you dont give out a key!*<br>

common asym types:
- Diffie-Hellman
- RSA (Ron, Adi, Leonard)
- ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
## Block and Stream Ciphers ##
__Block Cipher: breaks the input into fixed-length blocks of data and performs the encryption on each block. it determines a block size and uses padding if need to take to total data in chunks and encrypt it "block by block".easier to set up and less suspectible to security problems.__<br>

__Stream Cipher: Utilizes a keystream generator to encrypt data bit by bit using a mathematical XOR(one but not both) function to create the ciphertext. well suited for real time data transmission that requires bit by bit encryption whilst the data is being transmitted.__<br>
