## physical security! ##
__FOCUS:__ D1.2 and D2.4 ***
__def: measures taken to protect tangible assets, like buildings, equipment, people, and databases from harm or unauthorized access.__<br>
bruteforce exists irl too! 
phyical bruteforce: attack where access to a system is gain by trying all possibilities until breaking through.<br>

False Acceptance Rate (FAR): rate of which a system authenticates a user as valid, even though the person should not have been granted access.<br>
False Rejection Rate (FRR): rate which sys does not properly auth a valid user. <br>
Equal Error Rate (EER/CER): crossroads between FRR and FAR, golden standard of a bio system effectiveness.<br>

## fences + bollards ##
*bollards: short and sturdy vertical post to prevent access of vehicles in an area or structure.*
*fences:* ... not defining <br>
*IED: improvised explosive device*
may be like, why is this worth a section, but hear me out! <br>
1. provide initial visual deterrent via establishing a defined boundary that should not be entered with authorization.
2. creates a physical barrier that an attacker has to deal with.
3. delays intruders, giving time for security personnel to respond.

fences are for people, bollards are for cars!<br>

## Surveillance System: ##
__def: organized strategy or setup designed to observe and report activities in a given area. think camera system for example.__<br>
can be a combination of multiple security tools, like cameras, sensors, and security personnel.<br>
wired vs wireless cameras:
- wireless is suspetible to get jammed by frequencies either naturally or by an attacker
- wired is harder to install.

_Pan-Tilt-Zoom / PTZ : can move, zoom, and change angle of camera._<br>

__HOW TO BYPASS:__
- Visual Obstruction: block line of sight. (paint, tape)
- Blinding sensors/cameras: use burst of light to render it useless.
- Acoustic Interference: jamming / playing loud noises to disrupt a microphone's functionality.
- Electromagnetic Interference / EMI: jamming signals that surveillance systems use. (microwave jamming)
- Physical Environment Attacks: exploit environments setup (disrupt power, heat, fire...)

## Access Control Vestibule: ##
__def: double-door system with two electronically controlled doors that ensure only one door is open at any given moment.__

think outer inner door concept, before getting into inner, there must be some type of authentication.

__Piggybacking: involves two people with and without access, entering a secured area. (someone with access letting in someone without)__<br>
__Tailgating: Occurs whenever an unauthorized person closely follows someone with access without their knowledge or consent.__<br> 
types of locks:
- padlock
- electronic
- biometric locks (face, eye, finger, hand ...)

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
NFC (Near Field Communication)
Magnetic Strips

## Access Badge Cloning ##
ability to copying data from RFID and NFC tech to bypass auth systems

4 Steps:
- Scanning: use some type of reader to steal card info (hidden in a backpack or near card)
- Data Extraction: extract relevant data from scanning info
- Writing: flipper zero! take rfid/nfc info and add to new card
- Using: now the have an unauthorized badge to use!
