challenge on tryhackme
requires linux machine, gobuster, nmap, and reverse shell script

the process:
step 1: browsing...

created vpn for linux env
now on same network as target machine
test connectivity with server, can ping it
ok i want to figure out a little more abt the machine
use nmap command to find open ports and basically public info on the 
other machine
nmap __.__.__.__ -vv (be verbose)

ports 22(ssh) and 80(http) are open
ok.. lets try using this ports to talk to machine
tried ssh, but requires pw for communication
tried common passes but no luck
ok, opened a browser to see the http stuff,
theres a webpage that is teasing me to root to the machine
ok, from what I know from prev experiences, there can be other indexes on 
the page, so using a tool like gobuster to check is a good idea
ok lowkey took me a bit to understand how to use the tool, 
but after like twenty minutes of youtube review
syntax

gobuster dir _______
import commands
-u (link to target url) NEED
-w (used wordlist that it will dig with) NEED
-v (be verbose with errors)
-q (quiet, not too sure how it works)

ok so I ran
gobuster dir -u http:/_______ -w ______/common.txt

now after checking results...
in short, like eight paths found
some are forbidden / 403
index.php HTTP200
uploads css js panel all 301 (redirection)
