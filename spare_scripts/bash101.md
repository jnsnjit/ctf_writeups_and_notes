## bash scripting 101 ## 

*ok this is one tool i should be utilizing more and its bash scripting!* <br><br>

basically, instead of having to remember each line of linux code one by one, make a bash.sh script to do the heavy lifting for you!
only really important syntax is the beginning of the .sh file 

hello world:

//#!/bin/bash       #!
//# declare STRING variable
//STRING="Hello World"
//# print variable on a screen
//echo $STRING

after doing that, just make sure to make the file an executiable with this command

chmod +x file.sh       (make sure do this in the directory that the file is in)
