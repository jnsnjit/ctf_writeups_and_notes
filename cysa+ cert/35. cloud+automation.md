1. _Public:_ service provider makes resources for users over the internet. <br>

2. _Private:_ company creates its own cloud environment that it can only utilize as an internal resource. <br>
3. _Community Cloud:_ shared cloud resources from group of companies. <br>
4. _Hybrid Cloud:_ mix of multiple cloud solutions in one service. <br>
5. _Multi:_ cloud deployment where consumer uses multiple cloud services. (azure + aws ...) <br>

### Services Models ###
recap from IT340 and IT420! <br>

__Service Models:__ Classification of the provision of cloud services and the limit of the cloud service provider's responsibility as either software, platform, infrasture, etc... <br>

__SaaS__, __PaaS__, __IaaS__ <br>

### Cloud-based Infrastructure ###
cloud infrastructure CAN be just as secure, but a lot of time, the basic configuration of them is NOT secure!!<br>

_VPC / Virtual Private Cloud:_ private network segment made available to a single cloud consumer within a public cloud. <br>
