## Mitigating Software Vulnerabilities and Attacks ##

### SDLC / Software Development Life Cycle Integration ###
__SDLC:__ process of planning, analysis, design, implementation, annd maintenance that governs software and system development. <br>
- _Waterfall_: phases of SDLC model cascade so each phase starts after all tasks in the last are completed.
- _Agile_: SDLC model that focuses on iterative and incremental development to account for evolving requirements and expectations. 

Some Frameworks that you can follow! <br>
- SDL / Security Development Life Cycle: microsoft framwork.
- OWASP Software Security Assurance Process

__SANS / SysAdmin, Network, and Security Institute__ mentioned!

### Execution and Escalation ###
__Arbitrary Code Execution:__ able to run malicious code. <br>
__Remote Code Execution:__ transmission of code over a remote to run malicious code. <br>
_Privilege Escalation_
- Vertical: normal to sudo
- Horizontal: HR to Management
__rootkit:__ class of malware that modifies system files often at the kernal level. <br>

### Overflow Attacks ###
me when i buffer the overflow:
- __Buffer Overflow:__ attack where data goes past boundary of the destination buffer and begins to encroach in adjacent memory. <br>
    - _Smash the Stack:_ occurs when an attacker fills the buffer with NOP so that the return address may hit a NOP and continue on until it finds the attacker code to run
- __Heap Overflow:__ vulnerability where input is allowed to overwritememory locations with process memory allocation to store dynamically-sized variables (heap). <br>
- __Integer Overflow:__ attack where computed result of an data type is too large to fit in its assigned storage space, and if handled improperly, it can lead to a crash, data corruption, or buffer overflow. <br>

__Address Space Layout Randomization / ASLR:__ technique that randomizes where system functions are in a running application in order to mitigate buffer overflow attacks. <br>
