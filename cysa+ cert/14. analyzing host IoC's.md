## Analyzing Host-Based IoC's ##
fun section imo!
### Host-related IoC's ###
last section focused on the network --> this one we are considering hosts: <br>
- windows, linux machines, endpoints, servers ...

different section will consider mobile IoC's

### Malicious Processes ###
me when the process is malicious :p <br>

1. create a system baseline!
monitor when new process that are added and determine if they are sussy or not. <br>

__Malicious Process:__ a process executed without proper authorization from the system owner for the purpose of damaging or compromsing the system. <br>
__Abnormal Process Behavior:__ indicator that a legitimate process has been corrupted with malicious code for the purpose of damaging or compromising the system. <br>

__Windows Tools to Determine IOC's:__
- System File Check - SFC
![SFC Scan](sfc_windows_scan.png)
- Process Monitor
- Process Explorer
- Tasklist
- Task Manager
- PE Explorer (properitary)
__Linux Tools:__
- PS / pstree

SO Objects == Windows DLL's <br>
### Memory Forensics ###
YAY! <br>
__Fileless Detection Techniques:__ require analysis of the contents of system memory and process behavior, rather than relying on scanning the file system. <br>
__Memory Analysis Techniques:__ attempt to reverse enginner the code used by the malicious process, discover how it interacts with the file system, and how it interacts with the registry. <br>

FTK, EnCase, Volatility, Sleuth Kit, Memoryze ... <br>

VOLATILITY MENTIONED!!! (hate this fricking tool sometimes) <br>
### Consumption ###
### Disk and File System ###
### Unauthorized Privilege ###
### Unauthorized Software ###
### Unauthorized Change/Hardware ###
### Persistence ###
