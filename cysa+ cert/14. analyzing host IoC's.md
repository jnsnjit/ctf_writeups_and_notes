## Analyzing Host-Based IoC's ##
fun section imo!
### Host-related IoC's ###
last section focused on the network --> this one we are considering hosts: <br>
- windows, linux machines, endpoints, servers ...

different section will consider mobile IoC's

### Malicious Processes ###
me when the process is malicious :p <br>

1. create a system baseline!
monitor when new process that are added and determine if they are sussy or not. <br>

__Malicious Process:__ a process executed without proper authorization from the system owner for the purpose of damaging or compromsing the system. <br>
__Abnormal Process Behavior:__ indicator that a legitimate process has been corrupted with malicious code for the purpose of damaging or compromising the system. <br>

__Windows Tools to Determine IOC's:__
- System File Check - SFC
![SFC Scan](sfc_windows_scan.png)
- Process Monitor
- Process Explorer
- Tasklist
- Task Manager
- PE Explorer (properitary)
__Linux Tools:__
- PS / pstree

SO Objects == Windows DLL's <br>
### Memory Forensics ###
YAY! <br>
__Fileless Detection Techniques:__ require analysis of the contents of system memory and process behavior, rather than relying on scanning the file system. <br>
__Memory Analysis Techniques:__ attempt to reverse enginner the code used by the malicious process, discover how it interacts with the file system, and how it interacts with the registry. <br>

FTK, EnCase, Volatility, Sleuth Kit, Memoryze ... <br>

VOLATILITY MENTIONED!!! (hate this fricking tool sometimes) <br>
### Consumption ###
resource consumption is a key IoC, BUTTTT it also occurs with legitimate activity.
- CPU Utilization, Memory Consumption ...

establish a BASELINE --> able to understand good v bad activity! <br>

Task Manager | free -h | top | htop   <br>

__Memory Overflow:__ an exception in a program where it attempts to use more memory then it is able to access, causing unexpected behavior if not caught, and can be used maliciously to exploit program vulnerabilities. (access memory you SHOULDNT have access to) <br>

learn more about NOP sled! nop nop nop nop .... nop ... nop nop (overflow) ... beginning <br>


### Disk and File System ###
a lot of this section is IT340 review ngl! <br>

malware is still likely to leave metadata in file system! <br>

__Staging Area:__ a place where an adverary begins to collect data in preparation for data exfil, such as temp files/folders, user profile locations, data masked as logs, alt data streams, or the recycle bin. often compressed and encrypted! <br>

__Alternate Data Streams:__ feature embedded in NTFS where data can be redirect in where its being stored <br>

dir filters: <br>
/Ax --> filter file/folder types to only fit the matched (x) <br>
/Q --> displays owner of each file plus standard info<br>
/R --> displays alt data streams for files <br>

other IOC is if local disk is rapidly approach full disk space! <br>

__Linux File System Analysis Tools:__
- lsof: tool that retrieves list of all files open on OS
- df: retrieves how much disk space is being used by all mnt file systems and how much space is availible
- du: retrieves how much disk space each directory is using based on the specified directory

### Unauthorized Privilege ###
__Privilege Escalation:__ the practice of exploiting flaws in an operating system or other applications to gain a greater level of access that what was intended for the user or application. <br>

move from dummy hr account to system adminstrator level accounts! <br>
things to monitor for when dealing with privilege escalation!
1. Unauthorized sessions
2. Falied Log-ons
3. New Accounts
4. Guest / Local account usage 
5. Off-hours usage / Impossible Travel

Tools that can help with Access Control:
- Microsoft Policy Analyzer
- ACL's

### Unauthorized Software ###
me when gulp ... <br>

check /etc/hosts --> local DNS cache - can be malicious changed! <br>

__Prefetch File:__ file that records the name of applications that have been run, as well as the date and time, file path, run count, and DLLs used by the executable <br>
__Shimcache:__ an application usage cache that is stored in the Registry as the key <br>
__Amcache:__ application usage cache that is stored as a hive file. <br>

### Unauthorized Change/Hardware ###
me when bro be added new hardware to the switch rack without telling bro! <br>

### Persistence ###
recall the kill chain! <br>

__Persistence:__ The ability of a threat actor to maintain covert acces to a target host or network. <br>
__Registry:__ a heirarchical database that stores low-level settings for Microsoft Windows operating system and for the kernal, device, drivers, service, Security Account Manager, and the user interface. <br>

Windows IOC's for Persistence: <br>
- Registry --> malicious actors will make changes to run registry folder to allow for bad programs to start at startup of the machine. 

learn more about regdump! <br>

__Windows Task Scheluder:__ enables the creation of new tasks to run at predefined times <br>

difference between run and runOnce?: run will do tasks asynch in any order ... runOnce will do it in specified order. <br>
