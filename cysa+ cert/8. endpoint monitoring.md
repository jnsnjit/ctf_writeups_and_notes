## Endpoint Monitoring! ##
a important one imo! 1.1, 1.3 
### Endpoint Analysis ###
how to monitor an endpoint device on the network <br>
Five Types Covered:
1. __Anti Virus (AV):__ software capable of detecting and removing virus infections + other types of malware like worms, trojans, rootkits, adware, spyware, password crackers, network mappers, DoS tools, etc ... <br>
2. __Host-Based IDS/IPS:__ type of IDS/IPS that monitors a computer's system for unexpected behavior or drastic changes to the system's state on an endpoint. <br>
3. __Endpoint Protection Platform:__ a software agent and monitoring system that preforms multiple tasks such as AV, HIDS/HIPS, firewall, DLP (data loss prevention), and file encryption. <br>
4. __EDR / Endpoint Dection and Response:__ a software agent that collectiosn system data and logs for analysis by a monitoring system to provide early detection of threats. <br>
5. __UEBA / User and Entity Behavior Analytics:__ a system that can provide automated identification of suspicious activity by user accounts and computer hosts. <br>

### Sandboxing ###
signature-based malware detection is getting harder every day, so... we need to get our hands dirty. <br>
__Sandboxing:__ a computing environment isolated from a host system to guarantee that the environment runs in a controlled, secure fashion and that communication links between the sandbox and the host are usually completely prohibited. <br>

### Reverse Engineering ###
we LOVE rev on everyones soul!<br>
__Reverse Enginnering:__ The process of analyzing the structure of hardware or software to reveal more about how it functions. this is a static analysis! <br>

malware writer HATE people analyzing their code, so they make it hard...

__Disassembler:__ a computer program that translates machine language into assembly language. <br>

this exam covers magic numbers!!! yay my fav<br>
__File Sig/Magic Numbers:__ the first two bytes of a binary header that indicates file type. <br>
__Assembly:__ the native processor instructions used to implement the program. <br>
__Decompiler:__ software that translates a binary or llm language into higher-level code. <br>
strings mentioned :eyes:<br>

__Program Packer:__ a method of compression in which an executable is mostly compressed and the part that isn't compressed contains the code to decompress the executable (IVE SEEN BEFORE!).<br>

### Malware Exploitation ###
__Exploit Technique:__ the specific method by which malware code infects a target host! <br>

today... malware tries to be fileless, running directly in a shell to avoid file-signature based detection entirely. <br>

1. dropper/downloader: malware payload must be able to reach an endpoint.
2. maintain access! C2 control
3. horizontal and vertical reach
4. actions/objectives
5. concealment
think back to kill chain model <br>

Malware Types: <br>
- __Dropper:__ malware designed to install or run other types of malware embedded in a payload on an infected host 
- __Downloader:__ piece of code that connects the internet to retrieve additional tools after the initial infection by a dropper.

__EXAM WARNING:__ for CYSA+, when refering to "shellcode", it does not nessicary mean it was run in a shell, but instead it just being lightweight coded script. <br>

__Living of the Land:__ term that refers to using native tools on a system in order to perform exploits (A LOT HARDER TO DETECT!)<br>
