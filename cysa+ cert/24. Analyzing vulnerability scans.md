## Analyzing Vulnerability Scans ##
time to get more detailed on specific vulnerability scanner programs <br>
### Scan Reports ###
color-code + number associated!
details on vulnerability

these reports should remain very confidential, as its like the secret of all problems on the network. <br>

### Common Identifiers ###
- __CVE:__ common vulnerability and exposures, mantained for a very long time.       CVE-YEAR-Num#: CVE-2018-0144 = EternalBlue
- __NVD:__ national vulnerability database, superset of CVE's for NIST, additional info such as analysis, criticality metrics CVSS, and fix info
- __CWE:__ common weakness enumeration, list of software flaws that could lead to vulnerabilities.
- __CAPEC:__ common attack pattern and enumeration and classification, knowledge base maintained by MITRE that classifies specific attack patterns focused on application security and exploit techniques.
- __CPE:__ common platform enumeration, scheme for identifying hardware devices, os, and applications
- __CCE:__ common configuration enumeration, scheme for provisioning secure config checks across multiple sources

### CVSS ###
__CVSS / Common Vulnerability Scoring System:__  risk management approach to _quantifying_ vulnerability data and taking into account the degree of risk to different types of systems or information. <br>

0 - None<br>
0.1-3.9 - Low<br>
4.0-6.9 - Medium<br>
7.0-8.9 - High<br>
9.0-10.0 - Critical<br>

score is calculate by: <br>
base metrics + temporal + enviromental <br>
- Access Vector (AV): physical, local, adjacent network, network?
- Access Complexity: high or low?
- Privileges Required: none, low, or high
- User Interaction: none or required
- Scope: unchanged or changed 
- Confidentiality: High, medium, or low
- Integrity: H,M,L
- Availability: H,M,L

get a good grasp on how they are calculated, there will be questions on the exam! <br>

### Vulnerability Reports ###
this reports must be validated and thats because: <br>
1. True Positives: scan correctly identified true vulnerability in the system
2. False Positives: scan incorrectly identified vulnerability (time-consuming issue to fix)
3. True Negatives: scan correctly did not flag a false vulnerability
4. False Negatives: scan incorrectly missed a vulnerability in its report (BAD BAD BAD)


### Nessus ###
__Nessus:__ commerical vulnerabilitiy scanner produced by Tenable Network Security for on-premise and cloud-based vulnerability scanning. <br>
great tool to try at home this weekend on my lab set up! <br>

### OpenVAS and Qualys ###
__OpenVAS:__ open-src vulnerability scanner that began its dev from Nessus codebase when Nessus converted to commerical software. <br>
__Qualys:__ cloud-based vulnerability management solution with installed senser agents at various points in their network which upload data to the cloud platform for analysis. <br>
