## Vulnerability Scanning! ##
yee I am ready to learn! <br>
2.1 2.2
### Identifying Vulnerabilities ###
in order to mitigate threat vectors on your network, it is essential to be able to identify this vulnerabilities first! <br>
__VA / Vulernability Assessment:__ evaluation of a system's security and ability to meet compliance requirements based on the configuration state of the system as represented by information collected from the system. <br>

_Nessus, OpenVOS_

### Scanning Workflow ###
who conducts scan? when to do it? which systems? potential impact on systems? <br>
VA should work in a loop, learn, scan, fix, report, and repeat <br>

### Scope Considerations ###
_Vulnerability Scanner:_ hardware appliance or software application configured with a list of known weaknesses and exploits that can scan for their presence in a host operating system or within a particular application. <br>

_scope:_ range of hosts/subnets included within a single vulnerability scan. <br>
internal v external scans will yield different amounts of information based on permission, and authorization past a firewall. <br>

### Scanner Types ###
Different Types Include: <br>
- Passive: only analyze intercepted network traffic. <>
- Active: analyze responses based of probing the target. <>
- Credentialed: given an account with permissions. <>
- Non-credentialed: no login given. <>
- Server-based: scanner is launch from a server and sent to hosts. <>
- Agent-based: locally done, then sent to a host server. <>

### Scanning Parameters ###
1. Segmentation: scanner needs to know network layout.
2. Firewalls/IDS/IPS: scanner needs to be able to bypass these tools.

### Scheluding and Constraits ###
how often should you scan? depends on your risk apettite! <br>

when you start need scans, its important to understand ANY change to your network as well as new vulnerabilities that exist. <br>

__Privileged Access Management:__ PAM server gives temporary increased privileges, great for utilizing vulnerability scans with credentials. <br>

### Vulnerability Feeds ###
__Vulnerability Feeds:__ synchronized list of data and scripts used to check for vulnerabilities, also know as plugins or network vulnerability tests / NVTs. <br>

__SCAP / Security Content Automation Protocol:__ outlines various accepted practices for automating vulnerabilty scanning by adhering to standards for scanning processes, results reporting and scoring, and vulnerability prioritization. <br>
_OVAL / Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language:_ XML schema for describing security states and querying vulnerability reports and info. <br>
_XCCDF / Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format:_ XML schema for developing and auditing best-practice configuration checklists and rules. <br>

### Scan Sensitivity ###
_sensitivity:_ amount and intensity of vulnerabilities tested against a target. <br>

PCI DSS --> Requires Quartly Scan to maintain compliances   (FREQUENT EXAM QUESTION) <br>
### Scanning Risks ###
scans can crash a system, so be careful! <br>
VoIP, Printers, and other IoT devices are particular sensitive so be wary. <br>
